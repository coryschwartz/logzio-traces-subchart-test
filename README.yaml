This repo doesn't work.

If you have a chart that includes logzio-otel-traces as a subchart, the installation fails.

```
minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.20.5
```


Install this repo, with logzio-otel-traces installed as a subchart.

```
helm dep build .
helm install logzio-otel-traces-test . --set logzio-otel-traces.config.exporters.logzio.account_token=XXXX
```


and this is what we get

```
